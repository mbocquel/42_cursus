His name was Gaal Dornick and he was just a country boy who had never seen Trantor before. That is, not in real life. He had seen it 
many times on the hyper-video, and occasionally in tremendous three-dimensional newscasts covering an Imperial Coronation or the 
opening of a Galactic Council. Even though he had lived all his life on the world of Synnax, which circled a star at the edges of 
the Blue Drift, he was not cut off from civilization, you see. At that time, no place in the Galaxy was.

There were nearly twenty-five million inhabited planets in the Galaxy then, and not one but owed allegiance to the Empire whose 
seat was on Trantor. It was the last half-century in which that could be said.

To Gaal, this trip was the undoubted climax of his young, scholarly life. He had been in space before so that the trip, as a voyage 
and nothing more, meant little to him. To be sure, he had traveled previously only as far as Synnax's only satellite in order to get 
the data on the mechanics of meteor driftage which he needed for his dissertation, but space-travel was all one whether one travelled 
half a million miles, or as many light years.

He had steeled himself just a little for the Jump through hyper-space, a phenomenon one did not experience in simple interplanetary 
trips. The Jump remained, and would probably remain forever, the only practical method of travelling between the stars. Travel through 
ordinary space could proceed at no rate more rapid than that of ordinary light (a bit of scientific knowledge that belonged among the 
items known since the forgotten dawn of human history), and that would have meant years of travel between even the nearest of inhabited 
systems. Through hyper-space, that unimaginable region that was neither space nor time, matter nor energy, something nor nothing, one 
could traverse the length of the Galaxy in the interval between two neighboring instants of time.
