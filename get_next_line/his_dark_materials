Lyra and her daemon moved through the darkening hall, taking care to keep to one side,
out of sight of the kitchen. The three great tables that ran the length of the hall were laid
already, the silver and the glass catching what little light there was, and the long benches
were pulled out ready for the guests. Portraits of former Masters hung high up in the
gloom along the walls. Lyra reached the dais and looked back at the open kitchen door,
and, seeing no one, stepped up beside the high table. The places here were laid with gold,
not silver, and the fourteen seats were not oak benches but mahogany chairs with velvet
cushions.
